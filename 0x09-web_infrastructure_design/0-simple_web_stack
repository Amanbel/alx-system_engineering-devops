issues of this web infrastructure
1, SPOF
	the infrastruture is composed of a single server thus if the server is down it makes the website unreachable
	and the infrastructure doesn't have any load balancer so if multiple users wanted to access the website foobar.com the server will be unable to provide for every client.
2, Downtime when maintenance needed
	the infrastructure depicted has only one server operational thus making code updates and maintenace an issue,
	if servers dont have an extra duplicat when updating or fixing the issues of the server, the server might not be functional most of the time in turn decreasing availability and increasing downtime
3 cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
	lack of a load balancer and an extra server make it so that the website cannot be scalable if more users are accessing it
